## Project Description
The Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament of India, is made up of Members of Parliament (MPs). Each MP represents a single geographic constituency. The 17th Lok Sabha Election held in 2019 from April to May 2019 in 7 phase. Around 910 Million voters were eligible to vote and the voter turnout was 67%. This was the highest ever voting recorded by Election Commission of India. In this project, we use the dataset of candidates who contested the 2019 Lok Sabha Elections to examine what attributes make a candidate successful in this election, and try to model the mechanism using supervised machine learning algorithms.
